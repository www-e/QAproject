# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Optimize component memoization for immediate performance gains

  - Add React.memo to DashboardStats, TestsTable, DashboardSidebar, and other heavy components
  - Implement useMemo and useCallback in useChat and useTestFilters hooks
  - Fix LoadingContext to prevent unnecessary re-renders with proper memoization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Implement smart code splitting for dashboard tabs

  - Convert dashboard page components (dashboard, chat, tests) to dynamic imports
  - Add preloading for adjacent tabs using Next.js router prefetch
  - Create lightweight loading fallbacks that preserve layout
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.2_

- [x] 3. Optimize Framer Motion animations for mobile


  - Update animations.ts with GPU-accelerated variants (transform/opacity only)
  - Add will-change CSS properties to animated elements in DashboardSidebar
  - Implement reduced motion detection for low-end devices
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Fix memory leaks and implement cleanup




  - Add proper cleanup to useChat hook (clear timers, remove listeners)
  - Fix LoadingContext timer cleanup and prevent memory accumulation
  - Implement cleanup for all Framer Motion animations on unmount
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_




- [ ] 5. Add mobile-specific optimizations and monitoring
  - Implement touch-optimized event handlers with passive listeners
  - Add basic performance monitoring to track navigation timing
  - Create device detection for adaptive loading on low-end mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_
