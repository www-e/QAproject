# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive performance optimization for a Next.js dashboard application experiencing severe performance issues on mobile devices. The primary goal is to eliminate the 1-second lag when navigating between dashboard tabs while preserving all existing design elements, functionality, and animations. The optimization will be achieved through smart, calculated performance improvements that work under the hood without altering the user-facing experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want dashboard tab navigation to be instantaneous (under 200ms), so that I can efficiently navigate through the application without experiencing frustrating delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on a dashboard tab on mobile THEN the system SHALL complete the navigation transition in under 200ms
2. WHEN measuring tab navigation performance THEN the system SHALL show at least 80% improvement from the current 1-second delay
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN all existing Framer Motion animations SHALL be preserved exactly as designed
4. WHEN performance optimizations are applied THEN all visual design elements SHALL remain identical to the current implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the entire dashboard to feel responsive and smooth, so that my overall user experience is not hindered by performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads on mobile THEN the system SHALL achieve a Lighthouse performance score of at least 90
2. WHEN scrolling through dashboard content THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance
3. WHEN interacting with dashboard components THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
4. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN all existing functionality SHALL work exactly as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance analysis of all project components, so that I can identify and address every possible optimization opportunity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting performance assessment THEN the system SHALL analyze all React components for optimization opportunities
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL identify bundle size optimization opportunities
3. WHEN analyzing rendering THEN the system SHALL detect unnecessary re-renders and propose solutions
4. WHEN examining data flow THEN the system SHALL identify inefficient state management patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want smart performance optimizations that don't break existing code, so that I can improve performance without risking application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing component interfaces
2. WHEN applying performance improvements THEN the system SHALL maintain all current prop structures
3. WHEN optimizing components THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing tests continue to pass
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL not alter any design tokens, styles, or visual elements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want efficient resource loading and caching, so that subsequent visits to the dashboard are even faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement optimal caching strategies for static resources
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use code splitting to load only necessary code
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data loading patterns
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use optimized loading and format strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want memory-efficient component management, so that the application doesn't suffer from memory leaks or excessive memory usage on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all event listeners and subscriptions
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL avoid memory leaks in state management
3. WHEN handling animations THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage animation resources
4. WHEN components re-render THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocation and garbage collection pressure
